We don't really have time in units, cycle thru stuff

have a queue for the emergency room
Priotity 1 > priority 5

look into tokens and "split"
whole lines from the patient data are "cases"

for emergency room print some details so cycles are easier to follow


PART 2
Simulate 75 cycles w/o printing info
At the end print summary data
IE:
    # of patients that arrived, # seen, avg wait time for those who were seen



TIMECYCLE
for each cycle 0-3 patients may arrive with different chances each
look into using calendar

CODE
insert comments that explain problems and their solutions

Save DoB as an object(date), one way to do it is local date

usng heap because operations are O(log_2 n)
