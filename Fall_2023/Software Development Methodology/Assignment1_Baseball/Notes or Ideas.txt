"There will be several types of baseball players { pitchers, batters, fielders, and catcher }.  All of the players throw, catch, and bat differently. 

For example,

 batting - you can swing for contact, swing for power, bunt, or you might not bat.

throwing - you can throw by pitching, throw by throwing to another fielder, or you might not throw

catching - you can catch with a regular globe, catchers mitt, or with your bare hands.

 

Furthermore, your behaviors might need changed during a game.  For example,  a pitcher might bat if he is in the National League. Conversely, pitchers do not bat in the American League.  A player's batting, throwing, catching must be able to be change at run time."

actions will be the interface, something like

public interface Player {
	void bat()
	void throw()
	void catch()
}

which will then have a concrete implementation of something like

public class Actions {
	@Override
	public void bat(){
		//player bats
	}
	...
}
