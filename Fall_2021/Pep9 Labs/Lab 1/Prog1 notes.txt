character out for 4A and 6A
Decimal out for 006A and 004A

Display as hex
Use HEXO (only do this for original character)

other requirements
put data section in low memory and branch around it
--> 1)  have branch 
	have data below it
	branch will "jump" over data

Use A register
(make sure I know what is in it)
do: LDWA 0,i (this will clear the register)

LF: line feed
Write 0x0A to FC16
LDWA 0x0A,i

data:
orig character
capitol version

Notes:
This should work several times in a row.
This should work under the assumption the input will always be a lowercase number.


.BLOCK 1
LDWA 0,i
LDBA 0xFC15,d ;loads it
STBA 0xFC16,d ;prints it
STOP
.END

LF code
LDBA 0xA,i    ;line feed
STBA 0xFC16,d ;display
STBA 0x3,d ;store address A at 3

;;;; DISPLAY CHARACTER AND LINE FEED
LDBA 0x3,d ;load it
STBA 0xFC16,d
